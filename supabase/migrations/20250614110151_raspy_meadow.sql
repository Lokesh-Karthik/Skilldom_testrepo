  # Fix Profile Creation Issues

  1. Problem
    - Users getting stuck after profile creation
    - Need to allow non-authenticated users to create profiles during signup

  2. Solution
    - Update RLS policies to be more permissive for profile creation
    - Allow profile creation during the signup process
    - Ensure proper data flow from signup to profile completion

  3. Changes
    - Update INSERT policies to allow profile creation during signup
    - Add better error handling for profile creation
    - Ensure all related tables allow data insertion for new users

-- Create more permissive policies for profile creation
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own profile"

-- Allow users to insert their own skills and interests
